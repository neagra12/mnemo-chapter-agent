# Clio - GEM and course material for P465/565

## Overview
This is the support files and genrative artifacts from a GEM built from my pedagoical profile by Mnemo. This repo tracks both the GEM components and the .md artifacts generated from the GEM. These are slide decks, quizzes, assignments, ICEX, policies, etc. The .md are used by other tools to produce deliverable materials.
