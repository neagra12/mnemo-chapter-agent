# Purpose 
The first week, we are going to focus on building the team and learning to use one of our critical tools, the source control system, to coordinate work between the team members. 

The work product produced from this assignment will be a Team Statement document. This will be in a README.md file for the team’s GitHub project. 

This will also set Team Goals for the semester that will be part of the final exam Team Interview. 

 # Task 
Create an assignment1 branch in the team project. This needs to be pulled to each team members working repo.
Each member will create his/her own separate branch based upon the assignment1 branch. 
Modify the README.md file of the project to have the form of Team statement.
Each member will fill in the member specific elements of the form for themselves.
Each member will fill in some of the missing form elements. It is encouraged that the members work on some common elements to generate potential merge conflicts.
Each member will create a Pull Request to merge their own branch back to the assignment1 branch. (Do NOT remove the PR after the merge. We need to see all the PR's in your project.)
The team will then generate a Pull Request to merge the assignment1 branch back to the main branch. 
Submit the Pull Request of assignment1 branch to main URL to Canvas. This PR should be after all team member PR's have been merged into the assignment1 branch. 
Team Goals
This assignment asks the teams to think about the individual team members’ goals for the course as well as the collective team. The goals can be taken from the syllabus topics or from other sources. So long as they are software engineering-related, we will consider them valid for this exercise. These goals are unique to the team and should reflect the team’s unique interests in this course. This is your opportunity to make this course more tailored to your interests.

Each team member should be thinking about what this course means to them in three different ways. Each team member should generate two of each goals:

Seeking answers to questions: What questions do you think you ought to be able to answer if you have taken this course? The question may concern a software engineering topic that is NOT covered in the syllabus topics. We can look at incorporating this into the course material. 
Acquiring skills or capabilities: What skills, techniques, or capabilities would you like to acquire from this course.
Topic Understanding: What topics would you like to be able to explain and discuss concerning software engineering.
The team will then collectively determine 5 of each category for the team’s goals. The team will individually and collectively be evaluated on the goal achievement at the end of the semester. The specific details will be determined in the Team Interview.

 

 # Criteria for Success 
The team score will be awarded based on the completeness of the Team Statement. Are there cogent and applicable entries under each team section. Are all team members represented and have completed their information?

This is a Team Best assignment, so each team member will only receive the full team score if that team member has submitted their own PR to the assignment1 branch. Failure to have a members personal PR, will result in only half the team score being awarded to that team member. 

30 % of the assignment grade will be assessed during the Assignment Team Interview.

Below are the elements of the Team Statement.

## Team Name: By default your team name is Team #. Simple and functional, but not very inspiring.

## Team Goals: What is the collective goal for the team?

## Five Questions: Five questions the team wants to answer by the end of the course.

## Five Skills: Five skills or capabilities the team thinks they ought to be able to do by the end of the course.

## Five Explanations: The five topics the team should be able to explain and give examples. 

## Team Members: List of team members

## Team Experience:

- Programming Languages

- Technologies, e.g. Django, React, VSCode, etc

- Previous Projects: 1 sentence description of each project

## Team Communication Mechanism:

How, when, and where will the team meet and with what frequency?

How will the team share information?

How will the team know who is working on what?

Where will the team store information abut the team and the project?

## Team Decision Process:

How will the team make decisions? Provide details so for instance if by majority vote, how will the vote be defined, when will the vote happen and how will it be recorded? Etc.

## Team Contact: 

How does an external party communicate with the team?

 

## Per team member:

Name
Contact Info
Experience ( same categories as for team )
Class year, e.g. sophomore, junior, etc
Career Interests
Personal Interests or hobbies
A movie or book the member would recommend
Member's most impactful weakness
