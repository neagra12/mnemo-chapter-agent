# Decision Log for FA25 SE 1 final 7 weeks

---

## 2025-10-17 @ 20:06 EDT - Finalized SE 7-Week Plan (v5) - Streamlined Prerequisite Content

**Scope:** SE_Course_Gem (Knowledge Base: `7_Week_Plan.md`)

**Description:**
This change finalizes the 7-week plan to optimize the timeline and remove content that is already covered as a prerequisite for the course.

* **Removed Redundant Git Workflow:** Removed the "Git Workflow & Feature Development" lecture (old L7) and the corresponding "managed merge conflict" ICE (old ICE 7). This topic is covered in other courses, and its removal frees up a full lecture for more advanced feature integration.
* **Substituted Redundant Historical Hook:** Replaced the "Historical Hook" for Lecture 11 (Containerization) from "history of VMs" to the "It Works on My Machine" problem, as the former was also prerequisite knowledge.
* **Result:** The plan is now leaner and more focused, with all lecture slots dedicated to new, project-critical content.

## Changes to the team interviews
1. Interviews will be renamed to reviews.
2. Reviews can be online
3. The mid-term and final team interviews have been dropped. A team presentation outside of class will effectively replace the final interview. 
Reviews will be conducted every two weeks and is up to the team and the team TA to schedule the meeting. 

## Reduced number of quizzes first half of course
I failed to deliver two additional quizzes I intended to deliver in the first 8 weeks of the course. I am interested in making up those quiz scores in the latter half of the class.
