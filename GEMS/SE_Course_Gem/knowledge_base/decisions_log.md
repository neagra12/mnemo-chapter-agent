# Decision Log for FA25 SE 1 final 7 weeks

Here is the updated decision log entry that captures the significance of this structural change.

## 2025-10-18 @ 12:10AM EDT - Restructured Plan (v7) to Integrate Deliverable-Driven Skills

**Scope:** SE\_Course\_Gem (Knowledge Base: `general_plan_for_final_7_weeks.md`)

**Description:**
This change restructures the `general_plan_for_final_7_weeks.md` into a new, unified format (v7). This was done to formally plan for crucial learning objectives that are delivered **asynchronously via project deliverables** rather than in-class lectures.

The plan is now split into two main sections:
* **Part 1: The Lecture & ICE Sequence:** This is the existing 14-lecture sequence (unchanged).
* **Part 2: Integrated Project & Skill Kits:** This new section details the scaffolded, deliverable-driven skills.

This new "Part 2" explicitly defines and plans for three key components:
1.  **GitHub Project Management Kit:** A new, 3-cycle plan to introduce GitHub Projects (Kanban), Issues/PRs, and the Wiki, with specific tasks tied to each project deliverable.
2.  **React Deep-Dive Kit (Extra Credit):** Formalizes the extra credit path (our solution for the L10 "cognitive cliff") for students to build a React app from scratch.
3.  **Ethical Challenge Prompts:** Defines the delivery vector for these questions (quizzes and deliverables).

**Result:** This new structure provides a complete, holistic view of all learning vectors (synchronous and asynchronous) and their specific evaluation methods, creating a single, unified "master plan."

## 2025-10-17 @ 20:06 EDT - Finalized SE 7-Week Plan (v5) - Streamlined Prerequisite Content

**Scope:** SE_Course_Gem (Knowledge Base: `7_Week_Plan.md`)

**Description:**
This change finalizes the 7-week plan to optimize the timeline and remove content that is already covered as a prerequisite for the course.

* **Removed Redundant Git Workflow:** Removed the "Git Workflow & Feature Development" lecture (old L7) and the corresponding "managed merge conflict" ICE (old ICE 7). This topic is covered in other courses, and its removal frees up a full lecture for more advanced feature integration.
* **Substituted Redundant Historical Hook:** Replaced the "Historical Hook" for Lecture 11 (Containerization) from "history of VMs" to the "It Works on My Machine" problem, as the former was also prerequisite knowledge.
* **Result:** The plan is now leaner and more focused, with all lecture slots dedicated to new, project-critical content.

## Changes to the team interviews
1. Interviews will be renamed to reviews.
2. Reviews can be online
3. The mid-term and final team interviews have been dropped. A team presentation outside of class will effectively replace the final interview. 
Reviews will be conducted every two weeks and is up to the team and the team TA to schedule the meeting. 

## Reduced number of quizzes first half of course
I failed to deliver two additional quizzes I intended to deliver in the first 8 weeks of the course. I am interested in making up those quiz scores in the latter half of the class.
