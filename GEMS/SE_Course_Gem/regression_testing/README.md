# /regression_testing

## Purpose

This directory supports the quality assurance process for the Gem. It contains benchmark artifacts—the "golden set"—generated from a known-good version of the Gem's instructions. When instructions are changed, new artifacts are generated and compared against these benchmarks to ensure consistency and accuracy.

## Examples of Files

* `golden_set/SQL_Injection_Exercise_v1.md`
* `test_runs/SQL_Injection_Exercise_v2.md`
