## Session Summary for SE Course Developer

This session formalized the final structure and pedagogical intent of **Lecture 1** and **ICEX 1** for the Ministry of Jokes (MoJ) project kickoff, focusing on integrating architectural, ethical, and security concepts into the introductory technical material.

### Key Decisions and Content Added

1.  **Refined HTTP Request Example:**
    * The `HTTP Request` example was made **non-minimal** by retaining the elaborate `User-Agent` and **`Accept-Language`** headers to demonstrate their role as a **"side channel"** for application-level preferences, distinct from core protocol requirements.
    * The **`q-value`** (`q=0.8`) in `Accept-Language` was clarified as a **priority indicator** for content negotiation.

2.  **Integrated Ethics and Profiling:**
    * A critical note was added regarding the **ethical implications** of headers like `Accept-Language`. This data, logged at the infrastructure level, can be aggregated for **client profiling** (e.g., inferring nationality) and used for **price or content discrimination**, highlighting a core ethical responsibility for the software engineer.

3.  **Enhanced Justification for Web Frameworks (Flask):**
    * The lecture's primary argument for using a framework was formalized and strengthened by focusing on the **Statelessness of HTTP** and the resulting need for **secure Session Management**. This is presented as the single hardest, most security-critical problem the framework solves.

4.  **New Slide on HTTP Verb Security (Architectural/Security Enhancement):**
    * The discussion on why **`POST`** must be used for login (session initiation) instead of `GET` was elevated from a speaker note to a **dedicated slide**. This corrects the technical oversimplification and focuses on the true reason: **preventing security-critical Side-Channel Leakage** (credentials being saved in browser history, caches, and server logs).

5.  **Finalized ICEX 1 Structure:**
    * The in-class exercise was confirmed to include a mandatory **Project Board (Kanban)** setup, reinforcing the **"architecture and process"** focus on Day 1.
    * The **ICEX name** was standardized to **ICEX** (In-Class Exercise).

### Overall Pedagogical Impact

The changes transform Lecture 1 from a simple introduction to Flask into a rigorous foundation for **Software Engineering Architecture and Security**. The lecture now has a clear, logical flow that uses security and ethics to justify the use of mature frameworks. The timing and cognitive load were evaluated as **high but manageable** due to the strong narrative and effective scaffolding of the ICEX.
