## 1. Project Overview

> **[TODO: Team adds a 1-2 paragraph summary here.]**

> This section should answer the high-level questions for an **external audience** (like a stakeholder or recruiter):
> * What is the purpose of this project? (e.g., "A web app for a self-sustaining joke economy...")
> * What is the core business logic? (e.g., "Users must contribute a joke to see others...")
> * What is the high-level tech stack? (e.g., "Built with Python/Flask, React, and Docker...")

## 2. Developer Documentation
