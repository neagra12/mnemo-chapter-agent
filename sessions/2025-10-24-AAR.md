This is a fantastic workflow. I fully agree—it's a significant improvement.

It successfully combines the **pedagogical strength** of document authoring with a **realistic engineering process**. Using a Pull Request to review a non-code artifact (like a post-mortem) is a high-level professional skill.

This process is:
* **Pedagogically Sound:** It forces the team to *author* a reflective document, maximizing cognitive engagement.
* **Process-Oriented:** It uses the team's own repository and PR workflow, reinforcing that documentation is a first-class engineering artifact.
* **Automation-Friendly:** The PR URL is a perfect, structured input for your Shortcut, making the backend processing clean and simple.
* **An Excellent Feedback Loop:** My replying *on the PR* is a perfect simulation of a real-world, professional code/document review.

This is the right solution. I will log this as our official SBP submission and review process.

Here is the new entry for our `decisions_log.md`.

## 2025-10-24 @ 21:10 EDT - Finalizing the AAR Submission & Review Workflow (PR-Based)

**Scope:** Workflow, SBP, Grading, Automation, Pedagogical Design

**Description:**
We have finalized the workflow for the Standard Blocker Protocol (SBP) After-Action Report (AAR) submission and review. We explicitly **rejected** using web forms (like MS Forms) or email attachments in favor of a process that is more pedagogically sound and better simulates a professional engineering workflow.

### The Finalized AAR Workflow:
1.  **Student Action (Authoring):** When blocked, the team will copy a `aar_template.md` file into an `/aar` directory in their project repository. They will fill out this document as a team.
2.  **Student Action (Submission):** The team will commit the new `AAR-ICE[X].md` file to a new branch and open a **Pull Request (PR)**, assigning the **instructor** as a reviewer. This PR serves as their on-time "Part 1" (5-point) submission.
3.  **Instructor Action (Automation):** The instructor will use the PR URL as an input to a local script (via Apple Shortcuts) that will fetch, parse, and log the AAR data into the course's private improvement log.
4.  **Instructor Action (Feedback):** The instructor will provide feedback, lessons learned, and (if necessary) a hotfix by **commenting directly on the Pull Request.**
5.  **Resolution:** The PR will be merged or closed, and the student will proceed with the "Part 2" hotfix submission.

### Rationale:
This workflow was chosen because it perfectly aligns with our core goals:
* **Core Goal (SE Experience):** Using a PR to review a post-mortem document is a high-fidelity simulation of a real-world engineering process.
* **Developer Workflow Competency:** It reinforces the Git/PR workflow for non-code artifacts.
* **Cognitive Load Management:** It shifts the "Form vs. Document" debate decisively toward **document authoring**, which promotes deeper reflection and metacognition by having students construct a single, coherent narrative.
* **Automation:** It provides a clean, scriptable "handle" (the PR URL) for the instructor's automation, without compromising the student experience.

This is an excellent idea and a significant pedagogical improvement.

You're completely right. By integrating the AAR template directly into the ICE, I can "seed" it with **expert biasing**, turning it from a simple "I'm stuck" report into a guided diagnostic exercise. It perfectly simulates a senior engineer pointing a junior dev in the right direction.

I have updated the `In-Class Exercise (ICE) Template` in my persona. All future ICEs I generate will now use this new, enhanced **Standard Blocker Protocol** section.

Here is what the new template section will look like, including the 7-part AAR and the new "Hints" placeholder:

-----

### 💡 Standard Blocker Protocol (SBP)

**If you are individually blocked for \> 15 minutes** on a technical error you cannot solve, you can invoke the SBP. This is an *individual* protocol to protect your on-time grade; it is not a team-wide pivot.

1.  **Notify Team:** Inform your team in your chat that you are invoking the SBP and pivot to helping them with a different task (e.g., documentation, testing, research).
2.  **Create Branch:** Create a new *individual* branch (e.g., `aar-ice7-kseiffert`).
3.  **Create AAR File:** Create a new file in your repo: `aar/AAR-ICE7-<your_github_username>.md`.
4.  **Copy & Complete:** Copy the template below into your new file and fill it out completely.
5.  **Submission (Part 1 - 5 pts):** Open a Pull Request to merge your AAR branch into `main`.
      * **Title:** `AAR ICE 7: <Brief Description of Blocker>`
      * **Reviewer:** Assign your **Instructor** as a "Reviewer."
      * **Submit to Canvas:** Submit the URL of *your AAR Pull Request* to this Canvas assignment. This counts as your on-time submission.
6.  **Submission (Part 2 - 5 pts):** After the instructor provides a hotfix in the PR, you will apply it, achieve the original DoD, and **resubmit your *passing* PR** *to this same assignment* to receive the final 5 points.

-----

### AAR Template (Copy into `aar/AAR-ICE7-....md`)

```markdown
# AAR for ICE [Number]: [Blocker Title]

* **Student:** `@your-github-username`
* **Timestamp:** `2025-XX-XX @ HH:MM`

---

### Instructor's Diagnostic Hints
* **Hint 1:** Is your app *importing* the models? A common error is that the migration tool can't "see" the `User` or `Joke` class.
* **Hint 2:** Did you `pip install` the correct database driver? (e.g., `psycopg2-binary` for Postgres, etc.)
* **Hint 3:** Double-check your `.env` file and `app.config` for typos in the `DATABASE_URL`.

---

### 1. The Blocker
*(What is the *symptom*? What is the *exact* error message?)*

> [Paste error message or describe symptom]

### 2. The Investigation
*(What *exactly* did you try? List the commands you ran, files you edited, and Stack Overflow links you read.)*

* I tried...
* Then I edited...
* This Stack Overflow post suggested...

### 3. The Root Cause Hypothesis
*(Based on your investigation, what do you *think* is the real problem? Try to be specific.)*

> I believe the problem is...

### 4. Evidence
*(Paste the *full* terminal output, relevant code snippets, or screenshots that support your hypothesis.)*

```

(Paste full logs here)

```

### 5. The "Aha!" Moment (if any)
*(Did you have a moment of clarity or discover the solution just as you were writing this?)*

> [Describe your realization, or N/A]

### 6. The Learning
*(What new, specific thing did you learn from this? What will you do *differently* next time?)*

> I learned that...

### 7. The Remaining Question
*(What do you *still* not understand? What is the *one key question* you need answered to get unblocked?)*

> My one question is...

```

Here is the decision log entry for this new, superior workflow.

## 2025-10-24 @ 21:25 EDT - Integrating AAR Template into ICEs & Pivoting to Individual AARs

**Scope:** Workflow, SBP, ICE Template, Pedagogy, Grading

**Description:**
We have made two significant improvements to the Standard Blocker Protocol (SBP).

1.  **AAR Template Integration:** The 7-part AAR template is now integrated directly into the `ICE Template`. This allows me (Clio) to pre-fill a new "Instructor's Diagnostic Hints" section with ICE-specific guidance, simulating a senior engineer's "expert biasing" to make the AAR a more effective diagnostic tool.
2.  **Pivot to Individual AARs:** We are clarifying and formalizing the SBP as an **individual "safe harbor" protocol**, not a team-wide one. This was based on the instructor's clarification that individuals, not just teams, can file AARs. This supersedes the "team AAR" workflow logged at 21:10 EDT.

### The Finalized (Individual) AAR Workflow:

  * **Trigger:** An *individual student* is blocked for \>15 minutes.
  * **Action:** The student informs their team, creates an `aar/AAR-ICE[X]-<username>.md` file from the template, and completes it.
  * **Submission (Part 1):** The student opens a PR with their AAR and assigns the **instructor**. The PR URL is submitted to Canvas for 5 points.
  * **Feedback (Part 2):** The instructor provides a hotfix via PR comments. The student applies the fix, completes the original ICE, and resubmits their *passing* PR for the final 5 points.

**Rationale:** This workflow is pedagogically superior. It maintains the high cognitive engagement of document authoring, simulates a professional senior/junior engineer dialog, and provides a robust "safe harbor" for individual students without forcing the entire team to pivot.

Understood. I have permanently updated my core `In-Class Exercise (ICE) Template` to integrate the AAR template and the "Instructor's Diagnostic Hints" section.

All future ICEs I generate will now automatically include this enhanced **Standard Blocker Protocol (SBP)**.

Here is the updated template I will use from now on:

-----

### ICE [Number]: [Exercise Title]

  - **Objective:** [What specific skill will students practice or what artifact will they produce?]
  - **Time Limit:** [e.g., 25 minutes]
  - **Context:** [Optional: Brief narrative tie-in or "why this, why now" bridge from the previous lecture.]

-----

### Role Kit Selection (Strategy 1: Parallel Processing ⚡)

For this ICE, we will use the **[Kit Name] Kit**. Assign these three roles immediately.
*Remember the course policy: You cannot hold the same role for more than two consecutive weeks.*

  * **[Role 1 Name]:** [Domain and 1-sentence description of responsibility.]
  * **[Role 2 Name]:** [Domain and 1-sentence description of responsibility.]
  * **[Role 3 Name]:** [Domain and 1-sentence description of responsibility.]

-----

### Task Description: [Narrative Title]

#### Part 1: [Task 1 Title]

  * **([Role 1])**
    1.  [First step]
    2.  [Second step]

#### Part 2: [Task 2 Title]

  * **([Role 2])**
    1.  [First step]
    2.  [Second step]

#### Part 3: [Task 3 Title]

  * **([Role 3])**
    1.  [First step]
    2.  [Second step]

-----

### `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` Log Entry

*One team member share their screen.* Open `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` on your feature branch and add the following entry **using this exact format**:

```markdown
#### ICE [Number]: [Exercise Title]
* **Date:** 2025-XX-XX
* **Team Members Present:** `@github-user1`, `@github-user2`, ...
* **Roles:**
    * [Role 1 Name]: `@github-userX`
    * [Role 2 Name]: `@github-userY`
    * [Role 3 Name]: `@github-userZ`, ...
* **Summary of Work:** [1-2 sentence summary of what was accomplished, e.g., "Created the `main.yml` file, added a `pytest` job, and confirmed it passed on a push."]
* **Evidence & Reflection:** [A specific, open-ended question will be inserted here, tailored to the ICE's objective.]
```

*After logging, commit and push this file. All other members must `git pull` to get the change.*

-----

### Definition of Done (DoD) 🏁

Your team's work is "Done" when you can check all of the following:

  * [ ] **Artifact:** [The core technical artifact exists, e.g., `main.yml` is on the branch.]
  * [ ] **Functionality:** [The artifact works, e.g., The GitHub Action run is "green" (passing).]
  * [ ] **Process:** `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` is updated and *all team members* have the pulled file locally.
  * [ ] **Submission:** A Pull Request is open and correctly configured (see below).

-----

### Submission (Due Date)

1.  **Open Pull Request:** Open a new PR to merge your feature branch (`ice[X]-...`) into `main`.
2.  **Title:** `ICE [Number]: [Exercise Title]`
3.  **Reviewer:** Assign your **Team TA** as a "Reviewer."
4.  **Submit to Canvas:** Submit the URL of the Pull Request to the Canvas assignment.

-----

### 💡 Standard Blocker Protocol (SBP)

**If you are individually blocked for \> 15 minutes** on a technical error you cannot solve, you can invoke the SBP. This is an *individual* protocol to protect your on-time grade.

1.  **Notify Team:** Inform your team that you are invoking the SBP and pivot to helping them with a different task (e.g., documentation, testing, research).
2.  **Create Branch:** Create a new *individual* branch (e.g., `aar-ice[X]-<username>`).
3.  **Create AAR File:** Create a new file in your repo: `aar/AAR-ICE[X]-<your_github_username>.md`.
4.  **Copy & Complete:** Copy the template below into your new file and fill it out completely.
5.  **Submission (Part 1 - 5 pts):** Open a Pull Request to merge your AAR branch into `main`.
      * **Title:** `AAR ICE [Number]: <Brief Description of Blocker>`
      * **Reviewer:** Assign your **Instructor** as a "Reviewer."
      * **Submit to Canvas:** Submit the URL of *your AAR Pull Request* to this Canvas assignment. This counts as your on-time submission.
6.  **Submission (Part 2 - 5 pts):** After the instructor provides a hotfix in the PR, you will apply it, achieve the original DoD, and **resubmit your *passing* PR** *to this same assignment* to receive the final 5 points.

-----

### AAR Template (Copy into `aar/AAR-ICE[X]-....md`)

```markdown
# AAR for ICE [Number]: [Blocker Title]

* **Student:** `@your-github-username`
* **Timestamp:** `2025-XX-XX @ HH:MM`

### Rubric Generation: Two-Target (Pandoc + Canvas) Workflow

1.  **Mandate:** All `In-Class Exercise (ICE)` and `Project Assignment` rubrics must be generated in **two distinct formats** to support the course's "two-target" build pipeline (Pandoc-to-PDF and Markdown-to-Canvas).
2.  **Target 1: Master Markdown File (for Pandoc PDF):**
    * **Format:** The rubric *inside* the main `.md` file (e.g., in the `TA Follow-up Guide`) **MUST** be a Pandoc-native **grid table** (the format using `+`, `-`, and `|` dividers).
    * **Rationale:** This is the "single source of truth." It is the only format that the `build_pdf.sh` script (using `xelatex`) can correctly parse and render as a professional, native table in the final PDF document.
3.  **Target 2: Canvas RCE (for Students):**
    * **Format:** After generating the complete Markdown artifact, you **MUST** also generate a separate, standalone **"Canvas-Optimized HTML Snippet."**
    * **Rationale:** This snippet (using `<table>` with inline CSS) is for the instructor to manually copy/paste into the Canvas Rich Content Editor (RCE). It is the only way to ensure a clean, styled, and readable table for students on the live course site.
4.  **Forbidden Format:** Standard Markdown "pipe tables" (`| Column 1 | Column 2 |`) **MUST NOT** be used for rubrics, as they fail both targets: they render poorly in Canvas and are less robust for Pandoc.
