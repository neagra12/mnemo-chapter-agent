Here is the revised In-Class Exercise, updated with your feedback to use SQLite and incorporate the "I-WE-YOU" scaffolding for the database models.

-----

### ICE 7: The Ministry's Filing Cabinet

  - **Objective:** Define the core database models (`User`, `Joke`) using SQLAlchemy and create the initial **SQLite** database migration.
  - **Time Limit:** 25 minutes
  - **Context:** The Ministry of Jokes can't just shout "Hello World\!" into the void; it needs to *store* the jokes it receives. This exercise builds the "digital filing cabinet" (the database schema) that will form the foundation of our application. We'll use **SQLite** for this first cycle because it's simple, file-based, and lets us focus on the *models* without worrying about a separate database server.

-----

### Role Kit Selection (Strategy 1: Parallel Processing ⚡)

For this ICE, we will use the **Database Architect Kit**. Assign these three roles immediately.
*Remember the course policy: You cannot hold the same role for more than two consecutive weeks.*

  * **`Repo Admin`:** (Environment) Installs new Python packages, updates `requirements.txt`, and handles all Git operations (branching, committing, PR).
  * **`Process Lead`:** (Integration) Configures the Flask app (`app.py` or `__init__.py`) to connect to the SQLite database and initializes the `flask-migrate` tool.
  * **`Dev Crew`:** (Feature) Defines the data schema by writing and completing the `User` and `Joke` models in a new `models.py` file.

-----

### Task Description: Commissioning the Filing System

#### Part 1: Branch and Install (Repo Admin)

1.  Pull the latest `main` branch.
2.  Create a new feature branch named `ice7-models-and-migrations`.
3.  In your active virtual environment (`venv`), install the new packages:
    ```bash
    pip install flask-sqlalchemy flask-migrate
    ```
4.  Update your `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
5.  `git add requirements.txt` and `git commit -m "feat: add sqlalchemy and migrate packages"`.
6.  *Communicate to the Process Lead and Dev Crew that the branch is ready.*

#### Part 2: Configure the Database (Process Lead)

1.  Ensure you are on the `ice7-models-and-migrations` branch (`git checkout ice7-models-and-migrations` & `git pull`).

2.  Open your main application file (e.g., `app.py` or `project/__init__.py`).

3.  Add the following Python code to configure the app. *Place imports at the top and configuration logic near your `app = Flask(...)` line.*

    ```python
    import os
    from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
    from flask_migrate import Migrate

    # Get the absolute path of the directory this file is in
    basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

    # ... (your existing app = Flask(...) line) ...

    # --- Database Configuration ---
    # Use SQLite. The database file will be named 'moj.db'
    # and stored in the same directory as this file.
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(basedir, 'moj.db')
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False

    db = SQLAlchemy(app)
    migrate = Migrate(app, db)
    # --- End Database Configuration ---
    ```

4.  **CRITICAL:** The `moj.db` file is your database. It should *never* be committed to Git. Open your `.gitignore` file and add this line to the bottom:

    ```
    # Local database file
    moj.db
    ```

5.  `git add .gitignore app.py` (or `project/__init__.py`) and `git commit -m "config: initialize sqlalchemy and migrate for sqlite"`.

6.  *Communicate to the Dev Crew that the `db` object is ready to be used.*

#### Part 3: Define the Models (Dev Crew)

1.  Ensure you are on the `ice7-models-and-migrations` branch and have pulled the Process Lead's changes (`git pull`).

2.  Create a new file: `project/models.py`.

3.  Add the following code to `project/models.py`. **Your task is to fill in the `...` parts** based on the comments and the worked examples.

    ```python
    # We must import the 'db' object from our main app file
    from app import db 
    # Or, if using a factory pattern: from . import db
    import datetime

    class User(db.Model):
        # --- "I" (Worked Example) ---
        # Here is a complete, working example for you to copy.
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
        password_hash = db.Column(db.String(128))

        # --- "WE" (Guided Practice) ---
        # Complete the definitions below using the worked example as a guide.
        
        # TODO: Define the email column
        # Requirements: String(120), unique, cannot be null
        email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

        # TODO: Define the role column
        # Requirements: String(20), cannot be null, default value is 'user'
        role = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False, default='user')

        # TODO: Uncomment this relationship *after* you define the Joke model
        jokes = db.relationship('Joke', backref='author', lazy=True)

        def __repr__(self):
            return f'<User {self.username}>'

    class Joke(db.Model):
        # --- "YOU" (Independent Practice) ---
        # Now, define this entire model based on what you learned from User.
        
        # TODO: Define the id column
        # Requirements: Integer, primary key
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)

        # TODO: Define the joke_text column
        # Requirements: Text (use db.Text), cannot be null
        joke_text = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)

        # TODO: Define the created_at column
        # Requirements: DateTime, cannot be null, default to the current time
        # Hint: You'll need `default=datetime.datetime.utcnow`
        created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=False, default=datetime.datetime.utcnow)

        # TODO: Define the user_id (foreign key)
        # Requirements: Integer, foreign key to 'user.id', cannot be null
        # Hint: Use `db.ForeignKey('user.id')`
        user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
        
        def __repr__(self):
            return f'<Joke {self.id}>'
    ```

4.  **CRITICAL STEP:** The migration tool needs to "see" these models. Go back to your *main app file* (`app.py` or `project/__init__.py`) and add this import *after* the `migrate = Migrate(app, db)` line:

    ```python
    # Import models so migrations tool can find them
    from project import models 
    ```

5.  `git add project/models.py app.py` (or `project/__init__.py`) and `git commit -m "feat: define User and Joke models"`.

6.  *Push your commits.*

#### Part 4: Run the First Migration (Process Lead & Repo Admin)

1.  **Repo Admin:** Pull all commits from the Dev Crew (`git pull`).
2.  **Process Lead:** Share your screen.
3.  **Process Lead:** Run the **one-time-only** init command. This creates the `migrations/` directory.
    ```bash
    flask db init
    ```
      * **Verification:** You will see a new `migrations` folder appear in your project.
4.  **Process Lead:** Run the migration generator. This "reads" your models and writes the migration script.
    ```bash
    flask db migrate -m "Initial User and Joke models"
    ```
      * **Verification:** You will see output like `INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected new table 'user'` and `...Detected new table 'joke'`. A new script will appear in `migrations/versions/`.
5.  **Process Lead:** Apply the migration to your database.
    ```bash
    flask db upgrade
    ```
6.  **Process Lead (Verification):**
      * You will see output like: `INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade ... -> ...`
      * **Crucially:** A new file named `moj.db` should now exist in your project (in the same directory as your `app.py`). This is your new SQLite database file\!
7.  **Repo Admin:** You should now see the `migrations/` directory.
    ```bash
    git add migrations/
    git commit -m "chore: add initial migration script"
    ```
8.  **Repo Admin:** Push all new commits to the remote branch (`git push`).

### Pedagogical Analysis

  * **Core Goal (SE Experience):** This simulates a foundational task for any "greenfield" project: defining the initial data schema and running the first migration.
  * **Developer Workflow Competency:** This exercise teaches the `flask-migrate` workflow (`init`, `migrate`, `upgrade`), which is a core competency for managing database schemas in a team environment.
  * **Historical Context:** The `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` reflection question explicitly bridges the students' prior experience ("brownfield" flat-file editing in *Angband*) with the new "greenfield" database-driven approach, forcing them to justify the new technology based on past pain points.
  * **Creative Engagement:** The "Ministry's Filing Cabinet" narrative provides a simple, clear metaphor for the database (storage) and models (file/folder definitions).
  * **Cognitive Load Management:** This exercise uses an **"I-WE-YOU" scaffolding** approach in the `models.py` file. This manages cognitive load by providing a worked example (`User.id`) before asking students to complete guided (`User.email`) and independent (`Joke` model) tasks. It also uses **SQLite** to remove the cognitive load of managing a separate database service, allowing students to focus 100% on the ORM and migration workflow.

-----

### TA Follow-up Guide

  * **In-Class Goal (Workshop):** Your \#1 priority is blocker removal for model definition and migration. The goal is for every team to successfully run `flask db migrate` and `flask db upgrade` and commit the resulting `migrations/` directory.
  * **Final DoD (Due 11:59 PM):** A clean Pull Request with all new artifacts (`models.py`, `migrations/`, updated `app.py`, updated `requirements.txt`, updated `.gitignore`) and a complete `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` log.

#### **Grading Rubric (10 pts)**

  * **2 pts:** `requirements.txt` is updated and `.gitignore` ignores `moj.db`.
  * **3 pts:** `project/models.py` is fully and correctly completed, and the Flask app is correctly configured for SQLite (DB URI, `db` and `migrate` objects initialized).
  * **3 pts:** The `migrations/` directory is present, committed, and contains the initial migration script.
  * **2 pts:** `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` log is complete, includes roles, and provides a thoughtful answer to the reflection question.

#### **Common Pitfalls & Coaching**

1.  **Blocker:** Migration tool reports "No changes detected."
      * **Symptom:** `flask db migrate` runs but produces an empty migration file.
      * **The Fix:** They forgot the crucial import. The app file where `migrate = Migrate(app, db)` is defined *must* also import the models (e.g., `from project import models`). The migration tool can't "see" the models if they aren't imported.
2.  **Blocker:** `NameError: name 'db' is not defined` (or `datetime`).
      * **Symptom:** `project/models.py` crashes.
      * **The Fix:** They forgot `from app import db` (or `from . import db`) or `import datetime` at the top of `models.py`.
3.  **Blocker:** `AttributeError` or `ImportError` (Circular Import).
      * **Symptom:** The app crashes on launch, complaining about circular imports.
      * **The Fix:** This happens if `app.py` imports `models.py` *before* `db = SQLAlchemy(app)` is defined. The `from project import models` line *must* come *after* `db` and `migrate` are initialized.
4.  **Blocker:** Migration fails on `ForeignKey`.
      * **Symptom:** Alembic/SQLAlchemy throws an error about `Joke.user_id` or `no table named user`.
      * **The Fix:** They likely misspelled the table name (`'user.id'`). Remember SQLAlchemy conventions: the `User` class becomes the `user` table.

#### **Coaching Questions (for next team meeting)**

  * "I see your `User` model has a `password_hash` field, but we're just storing it as a string for now. What's the obvious, major security risk here, and how do you think we'll fix it in an upcoming lecture?"
  * "Why do we bother with a tool like `flask-migrate`? What would happen if two of you tried to add a new column to the `User` model at the same time on different branches? How would you merge that?"
  * "You used SQLite for this ICE. What limitations do you think this file-based database will have when we try to deploy our app to the cloud?"

#### **Feed-Forward Prompts (to prep for the next ICE)**

  * "You now have a database *schema*, but it's not being *tested*. Your CI pipeline (from ICE 2) only runs 'Hello World.' Your next task is to write `pytest` unit tests that create a *temporary, in-memory* database, add a new `User`, and confirm it was saved. This is the next step to building a reliable application."

### Task Description: Commissioning the Filing System

#### Part 1: Branch and Install (Repo Admin)

1.  Pull the latest `main` branch.
2.  Create a new feature branch named `ice7-models-and-migrations`.
3.  In your active virtual environment (`venv`), install the new packages:
    ```bash
    pip install flask-sqlalchemy flask-migrate
    ```
4.  Update your `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
5.  `git add requirements.txt` and `git commit -m "feat: add sqlalchemy and migrate packages"`.
6.  *Communicate to the Process Lead and Dev Crew that the branch is ready.*

#### Part 2: Configure the Database (Process Lead)

1.  Ensure you are on the `ice7-models-and-migrations` branch (`git checkout ice7-models-and-migrations` & `git pull`).

2.  Open your main application file (e.g., `app.py` or `project/__init__.py`).

3.  Add the following Python code to configure the app. *Place imports at the top and configuration logic near your `app = Flask(...)` line.*

    ```python
    import os
    from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
    from flask_migrate import Migrate

    # Get the absolute path of the directory this file is in
    basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

    # ... (your existing app = Flask(...) line) ...

    # --- Database Configuration ---
    # Use SQLite. The database file will be named 'moj.db'
    # and stored in the same directory as this file.
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(basedir, 'moj.db')
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False

    db = SQLAlchemy(app)
    migrate = Migrate(app, db)
    # --- End Database Configuration ---
    ```

4.  **CRITICAL:** The `moj.db` file is your database. It should *never* be committed to Git. Open your `.gitignore` file and add this line to the bottom:

    ```
    # Local database file
    moj.db
    ```

5.  `git add .gitignore app.py` (or `project/__init__.py`) and `git commit -m "config: initialize sqlalchemy and migrate for sqlite"`.

        username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
        password_hash = db.Column(db.String(128))

        # --- "WE" (Guided Practice) ---
        # Complete the definitions below using the worked example as a guide.

        # TODO: Uncomment this relationship *after* you define the Joke model
        #jokes = db.relationship('Joke', backref='author', lazy=True)

        def __repr__(self):
            return f'<User {self.username}>'

1.  **Pivot:** Stop work on the task and inform your TA.
2.  **Deliverable:** Your team's deliverable for this ICE is now a professional **After-Action Report (AAR)**, using the 7-part template.
3.  **Submission (Part 1 - 5 pts):** Submit your AAR *to this Canvas assignment*. This counts as your on-time submission.
4.  **Submission (Part 2 - 5 pts):** After we issue a hotfix, you will apply it, achieve the original DoD, and **resubmit your passing PR** *to this same assignment* to receive the final 5 points.

### Pedagogical Analysis

  * **Core Goal (SE Experience):** This simulates a foundational task for any "greenfield" project: defining the initial data schema and running the first migration.
  * **Developer Workflow Competency:** This exercise teaches the `flask-migrate` workflow (`init`, `migrate`, `upgrade`), which is a core competency for managing database schemas in a team environment.
  * **Historical Context:** The `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` reflection question explicitly bridges the students' prior experience ("brownfield" flat-file editing in *Angband*) with the new "greenfield" database-driven approach, forcing them to justify the new technology based on past pain points.
  * **Creative Engagement:** The "Ministry's Filing Cabinet" narrative provides a simple, clear metaphor for the database (storage) and models (file/folder definitions).
  * **Cognitive Load Management:** This exercise uses an **"I-WE-YOU" scaffolding** approach in the `models.py` file. This manages cognitive load by providing a worked example (`User.id`) before asking students to complete guided (`User.email`) and independent (`Joke` model) tasks. It also uses **SQLite** to remove the cognitive load of managing a separate database service, allowing students to focus 100% on the ORM and migration workflow.

### TA Follow-up Guide

  * **In-Class Goal (Workshop):** Your \#1 priority is blocker removal for model definition and migration. The goal is for every team to successfully run `flask db migrate` and `flask db upgrade` and commit the resulting `migrations/` directory.
  * **Final DoD (Due 11:59 PM):** A clean Pull Request with all new artifacts (`models.py`, `migrations/`, updated `app.py`, updated `requirements.txt`, updated `.gitignore`) and a complete `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` log.

#### **Common Pitfalls & Coaching**

1.  **Blocker:** Migration tool reports "No changes detected."
      * **Symptom:** `flask db migrate` runs but produces an empty migration file.
      * **The Fix:** They forgot the crucial import. The app file where `migrate = Migrate(app, db)` is defined *must* also import the models (e.g., `from project import models`). The migration tool can't "see" the models if they aren't imported.
2.  **Blocker:** `NameError: name 'db' is not defined` (or `datetime`).
      * **Symptom:** `project/models.py` crashes.
      * **The Fix:** They forgot `from app import db` (or `from . import db`) or `import datetime` at the top of `models.py`.
3.  **Blocker:** `AttributeError` or `ImportError` (Circular Import).
      * **Symptom:** The app crashes on launch, complaining about circular imports.
      * **The Fix:** This happens if `app.py` imports `models.py` *before* `db = SQLAlchemy(app)` is defined. The `from project import models` line *must* come *after* `db` and `migrate` are initialized.
4.  **Blocker:** Migration fails on `ForeignKey`.
      * **Symptom:** Alembic/SQLAlchemy throws an error about `Joke.user_id` or `no table named user`.
      * **The Fix:** They likely misspelled the table name (`'user.id'`). Remember SQLAlchemy conventions: the `User` class becomes the `user` table.

#### **Coaching Questions (for next team meeting)**

  * "I see your `User` model has a `password_hash` field, but we're just storing it as a string for now. What's the obvious, major security risk here, and how do you think we'll fix it in an upcoming lecture?"
  * "Why do we bother with a tool like `flask-migrate`? What would happen if two of you tried to add a new column to the `User` model at the same time on different branches? How would you merge that?"
  * "You used SQLite for this ICE. What limitations do you think this file-based database will have when we try to deploy our app to the cloud?"

#### **Feed-Forward Prompts (to prep for the next ICE)**

  * "You now have a database *schema*, but it's not being *tested*. Your CI pipeline (from ICE 2) only runs 'Hello World.' Your next task is to write `pytest` unit tests that create a *temporary, in-memory* database, add a new `User`, and confirm it was saved. This is the next step to building a reliable application."
