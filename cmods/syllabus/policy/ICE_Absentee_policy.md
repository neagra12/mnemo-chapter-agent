# ICEX Absentee Policy

This policy reflects the penalty for team members with unexcused absenses for the ICEX's starting Week 10. 

Team members can partipcipate remotely, but this will not work for all team members. The team will need at least 2 people present in the classroom with at least 2 others participating remotely to have a Team success on the ICEX. 

| Scenario | In-Class Outcome & Action | Make-Up Requirement & Grading | Rationale & Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Full Attendance (Team Success)** | Team completes the ICE and merges the artifact to `main` by the deadline. | N/A | **100%** for all members. |
| **One Absence** | Present $\mathbf{4-5}$ members attempt the ICE in class. The team must update `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` with the absent member's status during class. | **Absent Student:** Must complete the **Individual Remedial Drill** and submit a private PR with reflection. | **Present Members:** Eligible for **100%** (if successful). **Absent Student:** Capped at $\mathbf{85\%}$ of the team score. |
| **Two or More Absences (Automatic Failure)** | The present $\mathbf{2-3}$ members **immediately** update the `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` log and pause the in-class ICE. | **Team Make-Up:** The present team members schedule a make-up (within one week) to complete and merge the artifact. | **Present Members:** Receive **100%** of the 10-point ICE rubric score upon successful make-up. **Absent Members:** Capped at $\mathbf{85\%}$ of the team score (conditional on the Individual Drill). |

## Key Policy Rationale

* **Stress Management:** By defining **two or more absences** as an automatic in-class failure, we remove the pressure on the remaining small team to rush through a complex workflow in a high-stress, shortened timeframe. They are immediately rewarded for attending with the opportunity to do the work in a less stressful environment.
* **Rewarding Attendance:** **Present members** who complete the work (either in class or in the make-up session) are eligible for **100% credit**, reinforcing the value of attendance and commitment to the team.
* **Incentivizing Attendance:** The **absent student** must still complete the Individual Remedial Drill and is capped at **85%**, acting as a clear incentive to attend the crucial, project-critical workshop.

## Changes to Policy
I reserve the right to modify this policy througout the remaining part of the course, though it my intention not to. If I make a change it will be documented here as well as reflected in the policy statement above. Any policy change will not take effect until the following course week after the policy has been announced. This policy is being released in week 9 and will be considered in effect for week 10 for example.
