### 1. Student-Facing Policy (For the Syllabus/Canvas)

# Policy: The Standard Blocker Protocol (SBP)

In this course, we are simulating a professional engineering environment. Sometimes, builds break, platforms fail, or instructions are unclear. When you are genuinely blocked, you do not "fail." You **pivot**.

If your team is blocked on an In-Class Exercise (ICE) for **more than 10-15 minutes** due to a technical error you cannot solve, follow this protocol.

**1. Stop Work:** Do not continue to "spin your wheels." Call a halt.
**2. Announce the SBP:** Inform your TA, "Our team is blocked and we are pivoting to the Standard Blocker Protocol."
**3. Pivot to the AAR:** Your team's deliverable for the ICE *is now the After-Action Report (AAR)*.
**4. Submit the AAR:** Submit your completed AAR (using the standard 7-part template) to the **"ICE AAR Submission"** assignment in Canvas.

### The SBP Guarantee & "5+5" Grading
This protocol is your "safe harbor." It guarantees you will not be penalized for an on-time submission, but it *does* require you to complete the full engineering loop (Report + Fix).

* **Part 1: The AAR (5 pts)**
    * Submitting a professional, on-time AAR to the AAR assignment counts as your "on-time" submission and is worth the first **5 (out of 10) points** for that ICE.
    * This submission automatically **suspends the due date** for your team for the *original* ICE.

* **Part 2: The Hotfix (5 pts)**
    * The instructor will respond with a **Hotfix** (either as an announcement or an individual reply).
    * You will receive the **remaining 5 points** after you apply the hotfix, achieve the *original* Definition of Done, and **resubmit the original ICE** (e.g., the passing PR).

A low-effort AAR (e.g., "It's broken") will receive 0/5 for Part 1. The AAR *itself* is the deliverable we are grading for this part.
