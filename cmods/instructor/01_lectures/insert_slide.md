## Slide 15: SBP Workflow: From Blocker to Fix
- **Key Point:** This is a two-part process: **Report** (for 5pts) and **Resolve** (for 5pts). The PR is the central communication log.

### Part 1: Report (Student ➡️ TA)
1.  **Invoke SBP:** You're stuck > 15 min. You stop coding.
2.  **Create Branch:** Create a new branch (e.g., `aar-ice7-username`).
3.  **Write AAR:** Create `aar/AAR-ICE7-username.md` and fill it out completely.
4.  **Open PR:** Push your branch and open a Pull Request.
    * **Title:** `AAR ICE 7: Circular Import Error`
    * **Reviewers:** Assign your Instructor & TA.
5.  **Submit (5 pts):** Submit the AAR PR link to Canvas. This is your "on-time" submission.

### Part Two: Resolve (TA ➡️ Student ➡️ TA)
6.  **Diagnose (TA/Instructor):** We investigate your AAR and **comment on the PR** with hints, questions, or a direct fix. We *leave the PR open*.
7.  **Apply Fix (Student):** You read the comments. You apply the fix and **push the working code to your AAR branch**. This automatically updates the PR.
8.  **Verify & Complete (5 pts):** We see your new push and your passing code. You resubmit the *same PR link* to Canvas for the final 5 points.

- **Speaker Note:** Emphasize that the new AAR branch (e.g., `aar-ice7-username`) must be created **from their team's current activity branch** (e.g., `ice7-the-a-team`), *not* from `main`. This ensures their AAR branch has all the team's latest code for us to debug.
