# ICE 1: Founding the Ministry of Jokes

## ICE 1: MoJ Kickoff - Repo & Round-Trip Sync

  - **Objective:** To create the team's "Ministry of Jokes" (MoJ) repository, test all members' Git synchronization, deploy and verify the test scaffolding, and sync the minimal application code.
  - **Time Limit:** 25 minutes
  - **Context:** This is a high-fidelity simulation of a "Day 0" professional workflow. We will sequentially de-risk our project: first, testing our connections (Sync 1), then verifying our test harness (the ICE 2 dependency), and finally, syncing our first "feature" (the app).

-----

## Role Kit Selection (Strategy 1: Parallel Processing ⚡)

For this ICE, we will use the **Founding Engineer's Kit**. Assign these three roles immediately.
*Remember the course policy: You cannot hold the same role for more than two consecutive weeks.*

  * **Repo Admin:** (GitHub) Creates the repository on `github.iu.edu` and manages collaborators.
  * **Process Lead:** (Git & Scaffolding) Creates the feature branch, pushes the *initial scaffolding* (test harness, requirements), and later pushes the final `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` log.
  * **Dev Crew:** (Code & Verification) Verifies the scaffolding, *then* creates and verifies the `app.py` feature.

-----

## Task Description: Project Ignition

### Part 1: Repository Creation

  * **([Repo Admin])**
    1.  Navigate to **`github.iu.edu`** (our private, enterprise GitHub).
    2.  Create a new **private** repository.
    3.  **Repository Name:** `FA25-SE1-TeamXX-moj` (where `XX` is your two-digit team number).
    4.  **Initialize this repository with a `README.md` file.**
    5.  **Select the MIT License. This will create a `LICENSE` file in your repo.**
    6.  Go to `Settings` $\rightarrow$ `Collaborators`.
    7.  Add every member of your team, your **Team TA**, and the **Instructor (`@seiffert`)** as collaborators.

### Part 2: Initial Clone

  * **([All Team Members])**
    1.  `git clone` the new repository using SSH: `git clone git@github.iu.edu:FA25-SE1/FA25-SE1-TeamXX-moj.git`
    2.  `cd` into the new `FA25-SE1-TeamXX-moj` directory.
    3.  You should all see the `README.md` file on the `main` branch.

### Part 3: Branch & Scaffolding Push

  * **([Process Lead])**
    1.  Create the feature branch: `git checkout -b ice1-repo-setup`
    2.  **Create the scaffolding files:** Copy/paste the contents below into the correct new files. <span style="color:#d9534f;">**NOTE:** Check your indentation when pasting from the ICE PDF.</span>
          * Create `.gitignore`
            ```.gitignore
            # Python
            venv/
            *.pyc
            __pycache__/
            .env

            # IDE
            .vscode/
            .idea/
            ```
          * Create `requirements.txt` (This is a critical dependency for ICE 2)
            ```text
            flask
            pytest
            ```
          * Create `tests/` directory: `mkdir tests`
          * Create `tests/test_app.py` (This is a critical dependency for ICE 2)
            ```python
            def test_placeholder():
                """
                This is a placeholder test to ensure pytest
                passes on the initial CI run in ICE 2.
                """
                assert True
            ```
    3.  Commit and push this scaffolding:
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "chore: add branch, gitignore, and test scaffold"
        git push -u origin ice1-repo-setup
        ```
    4.  **Announce to your team:** "**Sync 1\!** Pull the new branch and scaffolding\!"

### Part 4: Synchronization Test 1 (Scaffolding Pull)

  * **([All Team Members])**
    1.  Fetch all new branches: `git fetch`
    2.  Check out the feature branch: `git checkout ice1-repo-setup`
    3.  Pull the new files: `git pull`
    4.  **Goal:** You must see `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, and `tests/test_app.py` appear locally. If this fails, **stop and ask a TA for help.** This step clears both the SSH blocker and the ICE 2 dependency.

### Part 5: App Creation & Local Verification

  * **([Dev Crew])**
    1.  **Verify the Scaffolding:**
        1.  Create the virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
        2.  Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate` (You should see `(venv)` in your prompt).
        3.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
        4.  **Verify Tests (ICE 2 Dep):** Run `pytest`. You **must** see one test pass. This proves the *scaffolding* is functional.
    2.  **Create the Application Code:**
          * **Pedagogical Maxim:** "Verify scaffolding, *then* add features." Now that you've proven the test harness works, create the `app.py` file. (Feel free to give your MoJ its own persona.)
            ```python
            from flask import Flask, jsonify

            app = Flask(__name__)

            @app.route("/")
            def hello_world():
                """
                A simple 'Hello World' endpoint to verify the app is running.
                """
                return jsonify({
                    "message": "Ministry of Jokes is now open!",
                    "version": 0.1
                })
            ```
    3.  **Verify the Application Code:**
          * **Pedagogical Maxim:** "Verify locally, *then* push."
          * Run `flask --app app run --debug`. You **must** see the server running.
    4.  Once both `pytest` and `flask run` are verified, commit and push the app:
        ```bash
        git add app.py
        git commit -m "feat: add initial flask app"
        git push
        ```
    5.  **Announce to the Process Lead:** "App is pushed and verified\!"

### Part 6: Process Logging (Sync 2)

  * **([Process Lead])**
    1.  **Wait for the Dev Crew's announcement.**
    2.  Pull their new file: `git pull` (You should see `app.py` appear).
    3.  Create a file named `CONTRIBUTIONS.md`.
    4.  Add the log entry (see template below) to this file.
    5.  Commit and push this file:
        ```bash
        git add CONTRIBUTIONS.md
        git commit -m "docs: log ICE 1 roles and work"
        git push
        ```
    6.  **Announce to your team:** "**Sync 2\!** Pull the final log file\!"

### Part 7: Final Team Synchronization

  * **([All Team Members])**
    1.  Run `git pull`.
    2.  **Goal:** Everyone on the team must have the final `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` file on their local machine. When you run `git pull` and see "Already up to date," you are synchronized.

-----

## `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` Log Entry

*One team member (Process Lead) share their screen.* Open `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` on your feature branch (`ice1-repo-setup`) and add the following entry **using this exact format**:

```markdown
#### ICE 1: MoJ Kickoff - Repo & Round-Trip Sync
* **Date:** 2025-10-20
* **Team Members Present:** `@github-user1`, `@github-user2`, ...
* **Roles:**
    * Repo Admin: `@github-userX`
    * Process Lead: `@github-userY`
    * Dev Crew: `@github-userZ`, ...
* **Summary of Work:** Created the repo. The Process Lead pushed the test scaffold (Sync 1). The Dev Crew locally verified `pytest` and `flask run` *before* pushing the `app.py` file. Completed a final round-trip sync (Sync 2).
* **Evidence & Reflection:** In Part 5, the `Dev Crew` manually ran pytest to get local evidence. This process relies on trust. What is the professional risk of a workflow that relies on trusting every engineer to remember to run tests, and how does this build the case for automation (CI)?
```

*After logging, commit and push this file. All other members must `git pull` to get the change.*

## Definition of Done (DoD) 🏁

### In-Class DoD (Goal: 25 Minutes)

Your team's in-class work is "Done" when you can check the following:

  * [ ] **Synchronization:** **All team members** have successfully completed **Part 7** and have the latest `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` file on their local machines.

### Final DoD (Due: 11:59 PM Tonight)

The final Pull Request submission will be graded on the following "Done-Done" criteria:

  * [ ] **Artifacts:** All required files (`app.py`, `tests/test_app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`) are present and correct.
  * [ ] **Functionality:** The `Dev Crew` has confirmed that `pytest` passes and `flask run` works. (This is evidenced by the `Summary of Work` in the log).
  * [ ] **Process:** `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` is updated with all roles and a thoughtful reflection.
  * [ ] **Submission:** A Pull Request is open and correctly configured (see below).

## Submission (Due: 11:59 PM Tonight)

This is a two-part submission.

1.  **In-Class (Synchronization):** Your TA will verify your team's synchronization status at the end of the ICE.
2.  **Homework (Pull Request):** **One team member** (e.g., the Process Lead) is responsible for opening the final Pull Request after class.
      * **Open Pull Request:** Open a new PR to merge your feature branch (`ice1-repo-setup`) into `main`.
      * **Title:** `ICE 1: MoJ Kickoff - Repo & Round-Trip Sync`
